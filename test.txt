SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) is a discipline that combines software engineering and operations to create and manage highly scalable, reliable, and efficient software systems. The purpose of SRE is to ensure that complex systems are reliable, efficient, and available to end-users.

SRE teams are responsible for designing, building, and maintaining the infrastructure that supports applications and services, as well as monitoring and responding to any issues that arise. They work to improve the reliability, scalability, and efficiency of systems by using automation, monitoring, and testing to reduce manual tasks and prevent outages.

The ultimate goal of SRE is to reduce the time and effort required to maintain and operate systems, allowing developers to focus on building new features and improving user experience. By ensuring that systems are reliable and scalable, SRE can help organizations increase their revenue and customer satisfaction while reducing downtime and operational costs.
