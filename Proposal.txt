Executive Summary:

This proposal outlines the implementation of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices and presents a future roadmap for the development of a comprehensive dashboard with automated health checks. By adopting SRE principles, our organization has the opportunity to achieve significant improvements in application reliability, operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction. 

The initial benefits of SRE implementation will include enhanced system stability, reduced downtime, and improved incident response times. By applying SRE methodologies such as proactive monitoring, effective incident management, and efficient capacity planning, we can minimize service disruptions and maintain high availability for our applications. This will directly translate into increased customer trust and loyalty.

Furthermore, SRE practices will enable us to scale our infrastructure effectively and handle the growing demands of our business. By closely monitoring performance metrics, identifying bottlenecks, and optimizing system resources, we can ensure smooth operations even during periods of high traffic or increased workloads. This will result in improved application performance, reduced latency, and faster response times, ultimately enhancing the user experience.

Looking towards the future, we propose the development of a comprehensive dashboard that provides service owners with a holistic view of application-related Configuration Items (CIs) and their associated details. This dashboard will enable them to have real-time visibility into the health, configuration, and performance of their applications and underlying infrastructure. Additionally, the integration of automated health checks will allow for proactive identification of issues, ensuring prompt resolution and minimizing potential disruptions.

By leveraging data from various sources such as ServiceNow API, Splunk API, and direct server access, the dashboard will provide service owners with valuable insights, including server configuration, vulnerability patching details, software inventory, and uptime information. It will empower them to make informed decisions, optimize resources, and troubleshoot issues more efficiently.

In conclusion, implementing SRE practices and developing the proposed dashboard with automated health checks will enable our organization to realize substantial benefits in terms of improved application reliability, operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction. By embracing these initiatives, we can establish a solid foundation for growth, while effectively managing our infrastructure and delivering exceptional user experiences.
