Current server management practices suffer from a lack of centralized monitoring and analysis, making it difficult to identify the root causes of issues promptly. This results in prolonged downtime, reduced productivity, and increased costs. Additionally, the absence of a comprehensive view of recent server changes, patching activities, and software installations further hampers efficient problem resolution. Introducing the Service Owner Dashboard, a powerful solution that offers a single point of control and visibility, enabling service owners to quickly identify and address server issues, track changes, and proactively manage server health, leading to improved uptime, streamlined maintenance, and optimized performance."
