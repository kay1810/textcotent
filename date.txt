To calculate the average incident response time, we need to calculate the time difference between the creation and resolution times for each incident, and then find the average of these differences.

Here are the time differences for each incident:

Incident 1: 2 days, 1 hour, 55 minutes, and 50 seconds
Incident 2: 1 day, 4 hours, and 59 minutes, and 51 seconds
Incident 3: 9 hours and 15 minutes and 9 seconds
Incident 4: 5 minutes and 24 seconds
Incident 5: 1 day, 16 hours, 8 minutes, and 39 seconds
Incident 6: 3 days, 11 hours, 58 minutes, and 53 seconds
Incident 7: 16 hours and 8 minutes and 6 seconds
Incident 8: 1 day, 4 hours, and 15 minutes, and 20 seconds
Incident 9: 0 seconds (same creation and resolution time)

Now, let's calculate the average incident response time:

Total response time = (2 days + 1 day + 9 hours + 5 minutes + 1 day + 3 days + 16 hours + 1 day) + (1 hour + 4 hours + 15 minutes + 55 minutes + 8 minutes) + (55 seconds + 51 seconds + 9 seconds + 24 seconds + 39 seconds + 53 seconds + 6 seconds + 20 seconds)
                 = 10 days + 4 hours + 57 minutes + 228 seconds

Number of incidents = 9

Average incident response time = Total response time / Number of incidents
                           = (10 days + 4 hours + 57 minutes + 228 seconds) / 9

Now, let's convert the total response time to a single unit (seconds):

10 days = 10 * 24 hours = 240 hours = 240 * 60 minutes = 14400 minutes = 14400 * 60 seconds = 864000 seconds
4 hours = 4 * 60 minutes = 240 minutes = 240 * 60 seconds = 14400 seconds
57 minutes = 57 * 60 seconds = 3420 seconds

Total response time (in seconds) = 864000 seconds + 14400 seconds + 3420 seconds + 228 seconds
                                 = 882048 seconds

Average incident response time = 882048 seconds / 9
                               = 98005.33 seconds (rounded to 2 decimal places)

Therefore, the average incident response time is approximately 98005.33 seconds.
